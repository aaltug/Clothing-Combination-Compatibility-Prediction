# ðŸ‘— Outfit Compatibility Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the compatibility of 3-piece fashion outfits consisting of a top, bottom, and shoes using image-based features and machine learning. By extracting features from outfit images and feeding them into a trained model, users can receive a compatibility score for their selected combination.

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Methods

- **Image Feature Extraction**: [VGG19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) pre-trained CNN model
- **Category Detection**: HuggingFace-based classifier for clothing item categorization
- **Compatibility Classifier**:
  - XGBoost (main model)
  - MLPClassifier (tested as alternative)
- **User Interface**: Basic Python GUI (can be developed using Streamlit or Tkinter)
- **Dataset**: Polyvore Outfits (filtered to 3-piece combinations)
